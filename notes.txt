Your main goal is to implement a song queue with some basic add/remove functionality.

A suggested path: Start by examining the Song model, then fill out the Library and its corresponding views. Once you've done that, use the App model & view to hook the library up to the queue. Once your Queue tests pass, get the Player to work the way you expect.
